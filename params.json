{"name":"Reclipse","tagline":"Reactive Debugging - REdefined","body":"## Why Reclipse ?\r\nDebugging reactive Software can be unnecessary complicated. We want to change that. With Reclipse we give you all the tools needed to debug your software in a comfortable, powerful way. \r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n### Reactive Tree\r\nYou have the possibility to inspect your variables, signals and events interacting with each other presented as nodes in a tree.\r\nAt a glance you can see the values of your signals and variables as well as the their dependencies and dependents. Manupulate the tree as you wish, drag it around, zoom in or out. Whatever it is that improves your overview over the code, the tree is there to help you with it.\r\n\r\n## Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
